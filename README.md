We can also observe that customer satisfaction is inversely related to resolve days, implying that fewer resolve days result in better client contentment.

   We obtain the number of satisfied and unsatisfied consumers for each complaint type, category, and source. We may enhance our analysis by obtaining a particular customer satisfaction count for the desired gender in the desired state for the intended product. We gain a better knowledge of which goods are underperforming and causing customer unhappiness, as well as how probable it is that a gender category may affect customer satisfaction for a certain type or category of complaint.
